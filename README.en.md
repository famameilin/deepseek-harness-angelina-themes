# DeepSeek Harness Angelina Themes

An independent `dsh-plugin` that ports the Codex Angelina light and dark themes to [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It keeps Harness interaction and layout behavior intact while adding the artwork, restrained parallax, readable frosted glass, and a durable theme picker.

This repository is a fork of [bilbillm/deepseek-harness-angelina-themes](https://github.com/bilbillm/deepseek-harness-angelina-themes) that tracks DSH core changes; upstream has been quiet since 2026-08 (see upstream [Issue #3](https://github.com/bilbillm/deepseek-harness-angelina-themes/issues/3)). Install commands below point at this fork. Differences from upstream are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Preview

The light theme uses a warm rooftop scene and pale glass. The dark theme uses a low-luminance night scene and cool glass. Menus, dialogs, inputs, composers, and user bubbles keep a visible separation from the artwork so copy remains readable.

  </tr>
</table>

### Parallax layers

The scene is composed from a background layer and a transparent foreground layer. The distant city moves only slightly; Angelina and the letters move a little more. Titles, selectors, composers, controls, and copy stay stationary.

Both palettes share one character image and one anchor; dark only regrades it (`brightness(0.62) saturate(0.92)`), so switching palette changes tone and nothing else.

The character carries her own scale rather than inheriting the backdrop's `cover`: `background-size: auto 88vh` with `background-position: right 40px bottom 0`, i.e. sized against the window height and hung from the lower-right corner. The backdrop keeps `cover` and the shared anchor. Sizing in `vh` with a corner anchor holds her share of the frame at any window aspect ratio.

## What changes in the UI

| Area | Treatment | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empty and active conversations | Same artwork composition and parallax; active conversations add shallow backdrop blur and a translucent tint | Conversation copy, titles, buttons, and inputs do not move |
| Header, sidebar, menus, listboxes, dialogs | Leaf-node frosted glass instead of filtering fixed-position ancestors | Open overlays keep their own edge and shadow |
| Composer, inputs, user bubbles | Translucent fill, backdrop blur, and a small saturation lift | Harness shape, sizing, keyboard behavior, and button layout stay intact |
| Settings | Dedicated Angelina picker with light/dark previews and durable browser-local selection | Unload restores the host theme and body attributes |
| Motion | Two-layer parallax with one shared character layer; dark regrades the same image | Reduced motion, touch, narrow viewports, blur, and hidden pages disable or reset motion |

    <td width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/glass-sort-menu.png" alt="Frosted glass on the conversation sort menu"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><b>Actions menu</b><br><sub>Translucent fill, fine edge, and soft shadow</sub></td>
    <td align="center"><b>Sort menu</b><br><sub>Group labels, selected state, and text contrast</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Glass recipe

The menu and settings-card surfaces share one recipe so the header, dialogs, and cards do not drift into different opacity or blur levels:

```css
background: rgba(43, 51, 58, 0.66);
backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(104%);
```

Glass is applied only to visible leaf surfaces. Sidebar/frame ancestors are left untouched so fixed overlays, scroll containers, and conversation layers keep their positioning. Active conversation content uses a shallow `3px` backdrop blur while its text and controls remain sharp.

### Motion contract

| Mode | Background | Foreground | Intent |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Angelina light | `-5 / -3` | `10 / 6` | A clear sense of depth without moving the UI |
| Angelina dark | `-5 / -3` | `10 / 6` | Identical to light: one shared character layer and anchor cannot drift apart |

Each pair is the X/Y movement coefficient after pointer coordinates are normalized to `-1..1`. The parallax layer has `pointer-events: none`, so it never blocks Harness controls. Titles, selectors, composers, controls, and copy are deliberately excluded from the transform.

The character layer's size and anchor (shared by both palettes, independent of mode):

```css
background-size: auto 88vh;               /* 88% of the viewport height */
background-position: right 40px bottom 0; /* lower-right corner (the layer box bleeds 16px past the screen) */
```

## Install

### GitHub (recommended)

Use a DeepSeek Harness Web profile with Node.js 20 or newer. `lib/` is committed, so a source install does not require a user-side build:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:famameilin/deepseek-harness-angelina-themes
```

Restart the Web profile:

```sh
dsh web
# or
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Open `Settings > General` and choose **Angelina themes**. Remove it with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-angelina-themes
```

### Local checkout

Useful when iterating on the source checkout. Relative paths are anchored to the directory where the command is invoked:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\lumoren\Documents\GitHub\deepseek-harness-angelina-themes
pnpm install
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

After editing `src/`, run `pnpm build` again and restart DSH. End users can install the committed `lib/` directly without building.

## Harness compatibility

- Published Harness `0.1.0-rc.6` projects active color mode and tokens but not the theme id needed by third-party selectors. The plugin synchronizes `body[data-ds-theme]` and restores its previous value on unload.
- The `feature/angelina-themes` fork already owns both theme ids. The plugin reuses existing definitions and registers only missing ids, avoiding duplicate-id failures.
- If the fork already owns `#dsh-angelina-parallax` and `body[data-dsh-angelina-parallax]`, the plugin does not add another layer stack or pointer listener.
- It can be installed alongside `dsh-motion` and `dsh-conversation-minimap`; this package owns the visual layer and does not take over motion-plugin or conversation data behavior.

## Build, test, and audit

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm generate-assets
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm smoke
```

Run the full verification sequence with:

```sh
pnpm verify
```

`src/themes.json` is the single token source. `src/assets/` contains the auditable WebP artwork. The generator embeds data URIs in the client bundle, so runtime rendering does not depend on a remote image host.

## FAQ

**The picker is missing.** Confirm that the active profile is `web`, restart DSH, and inspect the installation with `dsh plugin --profile web why dsh-angelina-themes`.

**Why is parallax disabled on mobile?** Touch input, viewports at or below `900px`, reduced-motion preferences, blur, and hidden pages disable or reset it to protect readability, battery life, and touch stability.

**Why did the theme disappear after choosing a built-in light/dark mode?** That is intentional. Returning to a host theme clears the plugin selection marker to `system` and does not overwrite host settings. Select Angelina light or dark again to re-enable it.
